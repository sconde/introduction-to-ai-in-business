Welcome and Congratulations!
============================

  
Udacity and Bertelsmann are excited to welcome you to the Technology Scholarship Program powered by Bertelsmann! (Introduction to Problem Solving with Advanced Analytics). Here are some helpful details as you start the program.

How the Scholarship Foundation works:
-------------------------------------

  
The lessons in this Foundation course have been specially designed to prepare you to take the full Predictive Analytics for Business Nanodegree program. We recommend you take the time to go through the carefully prepared lessons, as course completion is required to qualify for a Nanodegree scholarship.

Please note - there will be references to Nanodegree projects and some additional project materials provided. **You will not submit a project as a part of this course**. However, if you are selected as a winner for the full scholarship, you will be required to formally submit all technical projects per the suggested deadlines after you are enrolled in the Nanodegree program.

If you have questions, we encourage you to ask directly in our student community.
